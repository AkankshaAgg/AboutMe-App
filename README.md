# AboutMe-App

This app is made using **Kotlin** in **Android Studio**. 
It is basic interactice app which shows the information that I have fed about myself. Interactive because it can take user input in the field "What is you nickname?" and the name added can be changed again.

Following images show the working of the app: 
* First image shows the view of the app. 
* In second image, input "Anku" is added using Done button.
* Third image shows the content after scrolling up the text.
